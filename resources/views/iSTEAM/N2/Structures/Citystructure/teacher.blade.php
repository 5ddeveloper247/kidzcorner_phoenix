                    A structure is something that has been built using smaller parts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The structure of something refers to the way in which something is built or the way different parts are
                    connected together.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The structure of a building refers to the frame that is formed by the connected beams and columns
                    (the wooden or metal bars), which gives the building its shape and strength
                    to stand on its own and support weight.
                </li>
                <li>
                    How are tall buildings built? Who are involved in the construction process?
                    The two main designers of a building are the architects and the engineers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Architects draw a plan (called a <span class="italic">blueprint</span>) to design the look and space of
                    a building.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Engineers review the plan to make the design functional and safe by determining
                    the right building structures to support the design and deciding which materials
                    must be used to bring the architect's design to completion.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Construction workers build the structure from the ground up, floor by floor,
                    based on the finalized plan.

                    Architects concentrate on the artistic creativity of designs, while engineers focus on the scientific
                    innovations that bring those designs to life.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Engineers design and build a wide variety of things, including machines. They can also specialize in
                    different areas such as civil, electrical, mechanical, structural, industrial, sound, and chemical
                    engineering.

                    Engineering is a way of problem-solving using science and math. Engineers use creativity and their
                    knowledge of these subjects to design solutions to real-world problems.

                <li>
                    The process of engineering is fun and teaches valuable life lessons:

                        <li>It is normal to repeat the process of designing, testing, redesigning, and retesting.</li>
